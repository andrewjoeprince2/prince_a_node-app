# Andrew Prince - Video App
### Group A - MMED-3012

Using Node and Express, I have built a Roku video streaming application which allows users to filter through genres.

## Getting Started

### Ruby / Sass

Please install ruby, if not already installed;

*	Use `$ which ruby` or `$ ruby --version`, to verify if ruby is installed;
*	Make sure bundler is installed by running `$ gem install bundler`.

Please clone the repository from GitHub:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/andrewjoeprince2/prince_a_node-app.git
```

`$ cd prince_a_node-app`

### NPM and Grunt

Please install NPM and Grunt, if not already installed:

*	Use `$ npm --version` to verify is NPM is installed;
	*	If not installed, please install from [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/);
*	Use `$ grunt --version` to verify is Grunt is installed;
	*	Install grunt dependancies `$ npm install`, then proceed to run grunt `$ grunt watch`.

### Server

Once all dependancies have been installed (node_modules), run the server with the command:

`$ node app`

The server will then give a message in the terminal window, listening on port 3000. 

The route can be accessed through the url:

`localhost:3000`

## Contribution guidelines

1)	Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist;
2)	Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug;
3)	Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue;
4)	Fork the repository on GitHub.

#### Making Changes:

**Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.**

*	This is usually the master branch;
*	Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch;
*	Please avoid working directly on the master branch;
*	Make commits of logical units;
*	Check for unnecessary whitespace with `$ git diff --check` before committing;
*	Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format;
*	Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes;
*	Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
